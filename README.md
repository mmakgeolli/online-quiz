# online-quiz

This repo includes a quiz to test you on your JavaScript fundamentals!

The quiz will consist of 3 questions.

The acceptance criteria that I wish to meet in this project are the following:

- A working start button that starts the quiz
- A timer that counts down when the quiz has been started, which deducts the time remaining when an incorrect answer is submitted, and ends the quiz when the timer is 0 or less
- After a question is answered, the next question will be presented
- The quiz is done when all the questions have been answered, or the timer reaches 0 or less
- After the quiz is over, the final score and initials can be saved
